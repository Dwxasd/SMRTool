# SMRTool: A calculator for computing Slope Mass Rating (SMR)

SMRTool is a tool for the application of the geomechanical classification Slope Mass Rating (Romana 1993) which is it programmed in MATLAB under GNU GPL license. It allows to calculate the coefficients F1, F2 and F3 from the dip vectors of the slope (azimuth and dip) and the discontinuity (or the intersection line of planes in the case of wedge).

Automatically calculates auxiliary angles A, B and C as well as the type of failure (wedge, planar or toppling). Introducing the basic RMR as well as the type of excavation method  it calculates the SMR indicating their description, stability, modes of failure and system of support recommended by Romana (1993).
